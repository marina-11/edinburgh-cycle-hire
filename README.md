# edinburgh-cycle-hire-2
Year 2 data science project on the effect of lockdown on the Edinburgh cycle hires

This is the final project for the Informatics 2 - Foundations of Data Science course at the University of Edinburgh. All data was downloaded from the Just Eat Cycles website. The Just Eat cycles scheme has since permanently closed down on the 17th of September 2021.

You can read my final report for the course (pdf file) and see the code I used in the Jupyter Notebook file. I scored 84% in this assignment.
